# JavaScript Install, Environment, & Hello World

## Install
JavaScript does not need to be installed. It is a scripting language. Since it is browser based it is available on any system that runs a compatible browser (which most modern browsers are). (https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#What_is_JavaScript)

**_Since it's a scripting language you can just start typing and go, no boiler-plate code, making it fun and easy to start!! :-)_**


## Environments
1. Perhaps the simplest way to start using the language is to open any web browser, look in the Menu for Developer tools, find the option to use the console, then start typing JavaScript code. (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html)
2. Another way, and an easier way for me since I am addicted to IDE's, is to download an IDE that supports JavaScript. I like using Eclipse for Java so I tried installing the JS package for it and once I realized from this video (https://youtu.be/vpirrqkm0h8) that I need to make sure and add the .js file extension to my script file name it worked well.
3. I also tried my handy backup editor deliverer JetBrains. I downloaded WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and within minutes was using the functionality I like best such as a color scheme, tips, and embedded console.

## Hello World
### Using option 2 above follow these steps to create a Hello World program:
1. find the code on: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs98si/slides/overview.html
2. Open a new JavaScript project in Eclipse:
  a. go to File-->New-->JavaScript Project
  b. follow the prompt to name the project
3. add a new script file:
  a. go to File-->New-->JavaScript File
  b. follow the promt to name the file (remember as stated above to add the .js file extension)
4. type into the file: `console.log("Hello World");`
5. go to Run-->Run and look at the output in the console window



## Writing comments
### There are 2 ways to make comments (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comment-your-javascript-code):
1. In-line comments using `//` ex: `//in-line`
2. Multi-line comments using `/*   */` 
  ex: 
  ``` 
  /* multi-line
  comment */
  ```
