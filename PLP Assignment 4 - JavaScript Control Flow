# JavaScript Control Statements

## Conditionals
JavaScript has a full compliment of conditionals:
if statements
switch statements
while loops
do-while loops
for loops
for-of loops
for-await-of loops
for-in loops

## Writing comments
### There are 2 ways to make comments (https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comment-your-javascript-code):
1. In-line comments using `//` ex: `//in-line`
2. Multi-line comments using `/*   */` 
  ex: 
  ``` 
  /* multi-line
  comment */
  ```
